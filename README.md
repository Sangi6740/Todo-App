📌 About

This app was built as part of my Flutter learning journey by following a YouTube tutorial. It helped me understand core concepts like:

- Stateful Widgets
- ListView.builder
- Handling user input (`TextField`)
- State management using `setState`
- UI customization with `Container`, `Card`, and `InputDecoration`
